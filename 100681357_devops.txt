Devops info

teacher name: Pritesh Patel

class time is 5:00pm to 8:00pm

DevOps is a combination of software development and
information technology operations that enables
businesses to deliver applications at a faster pace

due to a bizarre error we have lost most of our marks prior to week 5

i have been mass uploading my work via the git add . command and it turns out that means my
my commits are lower then what is necessary to pass in this project

the mid-term is in week 9, final in week 15
