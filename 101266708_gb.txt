George Brown College is a wonderful learning and growing experience. 
They offer a variety of programs in many fields, leaving no one behind!
I am currently attending the Computer program Analyst program (T127) at their Casa Loma campus.
It is a wonderful course with amazing experiences and top-tier professors.
